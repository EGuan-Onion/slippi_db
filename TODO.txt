TODO
----

-- Code
- make subdirectories in setup

- readme.md
- - all required packages (python, js)
- - setup instructions

- run_sql.py and build_db.run_sql() names clash

- standardize the derived table flow, paths

-- Data Stuff
- is_win remove early ragequits?
- why more losses than wins?

- player_game_agg add character tier list for easy filtering

- tournament vs. netplay
- local vs. netplay
