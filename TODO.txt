TODO
----

- Standardize argv order (test, prod, paths, etc.)

- Make "local" db with ~10GB of data for mid-size testing
- Change paths.py to more easily switch between modes
- get rid of all those `if mode=='test'` clauses

- Discard unwanted game data.  
- - Requirements: 2-player, 4-stock, good stage, sufficiently long match.
- - Q: include ragequits or nah?

- Table cleanup

- player-game-opponent table
- - game length
- - winner
- - player, opponent (two entries per game)
- - known player filtering (connect code)

- Action State Union table
- - character-specific action states handled



UNFINISHED IDEAS
----------------

- player-aggregate table
- - player-level aggregate
- - games played
- - ?player-character and player-stage, etc. as separate tables?  Or as json maps inside here?
