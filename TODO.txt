TODO
----

- tournament player mapping

- make subdirectories in setup

- readme.md
- - all required packages (python, js)
- - setup instructions

- derived table ETLs (for PGO)

- name clash of build_db.run_sql() and run_sql.py

- player-aggregate query
- - games played, characters played, winrate by stage, etc.
- - the kind of stuff you see on stats pages

- fox_falco_laser.sql may be taking too long on production


NOTES
----------------

- player-aggregate table
- - player-level aggregate
- - games played
- - ?player-character and player-stage, etc. as separate tables?  Or as json maps inside here?
